## Getting started

* Install [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/). Rye is a new-ish Python project and package manager that is modeled on `cargo`.
  It also includes a linter ([ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)) and a code formatter (black).

```bash
rye sync
rye build  # this will run maturin
rye test
cargo run --bin run_perf_test --release
```

### Sample Databases

To make it easy to test queries locally, we've added a sample database in the
root of this repository: `sample.db`.

This contains two tables: `apples` & `oranges`. You can use this to test your
implementation for the first 6 stages.

You can explore this database by running queries against it like this:

```sh
$ sqlite3 sample.db "select id, name from apples"
1|Granny Smith
2|Fuji
3|Honeycrisp
4|Golden Delicious
```

There are two other databases that you can use:

1. `superheroes.db`:
   - This is a small version of the test database used in the table-scan stage.
   - It contains one table: `superheroes`.
   - It is ~1MB in size.
1. `companies.db`:
   - This is a small version of the test database used in the index-scan stage.
   - It contains one table: `companies`, and one index: `idx_companies_country`
   - It is ~7MB in size.

These aren't included in the repository because they're large in size. You can
download them by running this script:

```sh
./download_sample_databases.sh
```

If the script doesn't work for some reason, you can download the databases
directly from
[codecrafters-io/sample-sqlite-databases](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/sample-sqlite-databases).
